Codes for graduate course "Discrete Mathematics"

The main.c file holds the source code for a particular project, regarding the finding of the Greatest Common Divisor (i.e., gcd) of two integers a and b (i.e., gcd(a,b)=?) and the finding of two more integers s, t (i.e., Extended Euclidean algorithm) so that a*s + b*t = gcd(a,b)
