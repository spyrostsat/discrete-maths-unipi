Codes for graduate course "Discrete Mathematics"

The **extended_euclidean_algorithm.c** file holds the source code for a particular project, regarding the finding of the Greatest Common Divisor (i.e., gcd) of two integers a and b ( i.e., gcd(a,b)=? ) and the finding of two more integers s, t (i.e., Extended Euclidean algorithm) so that a*s + b*t = gcd(a,b).
